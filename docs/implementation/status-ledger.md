# Lighthaven status ledger

Coordinator-owned. Task IDs from `docs/plan/docs/05-agent-waves.md`.
Statuses: planned / active / blocked / reviewed / integrated.

Directory convention (owner decision 2026-10-07): project directories are lowercase
(`docs/implementation/`, `build/`, `reference/`, `artsource/`). Directories Unreal itself
requires keep engine casing (`Source/`, `Content/`, `Config/`, `Plugins/`, `.uproject`).
Where the plan says `Docs/Implementation/`, `Build/`, `Reference/` or `ArtSource/`, use
the lowercase form.

| Task | Status | Profile | Owned paths / binary assets | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| W0-01 rules + world ledgers | integrated (e0262f7) | codex-sol | docs/implementation/rules-ledger.md, world-ledger.md | Map-only facts marked needs-visual-check for W0-04 |
| W0-02 toolchain check | integrated (d5f10f2) | codex-sol | build/ | Proposes UE 5.8.3; Linux route chosen (see below) |
| W0-03 native contracts (draft, not compiled) | integrated as draft | codex-sol | Lighthaven.uproject, Source/, docs/implementation/contracts-v1.md | Schema rev 1 NOT frozen: freeze after first UHT/compile on UE 5.8.3 Linux and the integrator decisions in contracts-v1.md |
| W0-04 art/reference register | active | codex-astra | docs/implementation/art-register.md, reference/, artsource/ | Images stay at package path until LFS is decided |
| G0 | blocked | n/a | n/a | Linux: needs UE 5.8.3 Linux install + Epic v26 clang toolchain; git-lfs installed and .gitattributes adopted (f5d2135); UE 5.8.3 Linux zip downloading (owner). Windows part deferred (owner, 2026-10-07) |

Binary asset locks: none (no .uasset/.umap exists).

Platform decision (owner, 2026-10-07): build, run and test on Linux (brewtop) for now. Windows
packaging/launch checks are deferred to a later time and recorded as deferred, not passed.
